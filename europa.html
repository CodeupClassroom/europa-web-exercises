<h2>Mindset</h2>
<ol>
 <li><strong>Mistakes are fuel for learning</strong></li>
    <li>Attitude is contageous</li>
    <li>You learn more when you're having a good time. <br>Have fun & enjoy the journey!</li>
    <li>What you get out of this program <br>is a function of what you invest of yourself</li>
</ol>
<h2>Expectations - know what's coming</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Expect to read and write a tremendous amount of code.</li>
    <li>Expect to learn by doing. Form hypotheses, try things, and adjust.</li>
    <li>Programming is a skill that requires a little study and <strong>lots</strong> of practice.</li>
    <li>Work together, search for answers, and ask for help.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Succeed as a Codeup student</h2>
<ol>
   <li> Own your learning experience
<ul>
    <li>Make sure you're <em>solid</em> on vocabulary, fundamentals, and first principles</li>
    <li>Be honest with yourself and your comprehension. Be open with us. Ask for help.</li>
    <li>We can explain things to you, but we can't understand it for you</li>
</ul></li>
<li> Overcome learned helplessness
    <ul>
        <li>The <em>number one</em> learning objective: "Working with others effectively to find and solve problems in the face of uncertainty"</li>
        <li>Expect to work with things before fully understanding all the ins and outs</li>
        <li>The big take-away from Codeup is learned resourcefulness and increased automaticity.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li> Learn to problem solve (breaking down into small pieces)</li>
<li>Put in the reps (we can't lift the weights for you)</li>

</ol>
